        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Everyday our home is getting harder to sustain itself. Rising sea levels, warmer weather... it's not easy to
          deal with. My topic covers what the effects of climate change are that are happening right now. This is
          important because this effects everyone and it is a long going problem that many people have been trying to
          deal with.</p>

            <!--       NOTE for width editing: u want to use width="70vh", same for the height. what the vh does is that it makes the images mobile responsive, which is essential for every website. So, change the width="700" and height = "700" to something with vh at the end. For example, width="10vh" and height="10vh"  u will have to experiment which number works best to make it look like that current size of the pic you have. -->

          <h3>Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
          this has lasting effects all over the world. it is not concentrated in just one area but rather, it is spread
          out in every part of the world.
          <p>Why? The immediate answer that usually comes to mind is human activity. A lot of people credit climate
            change beginning to the industrial revolution where natural resoruces like coal that was burned that
            pollutes the air. But we havent stopped their, it has gotten even worse since then by everyday.
